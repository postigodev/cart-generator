# 🛒 Cart Generator

**Cart Generator** is a full-stack system that transforms a user’s **saved recipes and constraints into a structured grocery cart**, combining persistent recipe memory, deterministic backend logic, and LLM-based adaptation.

---

## 🧠 Core Idea

This project is **not** a generic AI meal planner.

It is a **stateful decision system** built around:

* **Recipe memory (what users actually eat)**
* **Constraint adaptation (diet, cost, preferences)**
* **Cart generation (real-world output)**

---

## 🔁 Core System Flow

```text
Saved Recipes → Selection → Optional Adaptation → Ingredient Extraction → Consolidation → Product Matching → Cost Estimation → Cart
```

---

## 🎯 Purpose

The system is designed to:

* Model **real-world food consumption patterns** (repetition, variation, constraints)
* Reduce reliance on raw LLM generation
* Demonstrate **production-grade backend architecture**
* Combine:

  * structured data systems
  * AI-assisted transformations
  * optimization pipelines

---

## 🧩 Key Conceptual Layers

### 1. Base Recipes (Persistent Layer)

Represents stable, user-owned dishes.

Examples:

* Ají de gallina
* Ceviche
* Lomo saltado

Each base recipe includes:

* name
* ingredients
* quantities
* preparation steps
* metadata (tags, cuisine, etc.)

---

### 2. Recipe Variants (Transformation Layer)

Derived versions of base recipes under constraints.

Examples:

* cheaper version
* halal version
* vegan version
* 600–800 kcal version

Variants are generated via **LLM-assisted transformation**, but remain structured.

---

### 3. Selection Layer

Users select multiple recipes to build a weekly or session-based plan.

This reflects real behavior:

* repetition
* partial variation
* stable preferences

---

### 4. Cart Generation Layer

Selected recipes are transformed into:

* aggregated ingredients
* normalized units
* matched products
* estimated total cost

---

## 🧱 System Architecture (Target)

### Entities

* `BaseRecipe`
* `RecipeVariant`
* `Ingredient`
* `RecipeIngredient`
* `CartDraft` (or WeeklySelection)
* `CartItem`
* `Product`

---

### Relationships

* BaseRecipe → has many → RecipeIngredients
* BaseRecipe → has many → RecipeVariants
* CartDraft → has many → Recipes (base or variant)
* Recipe → has many → Ingredients
* Ingredients → map to → Products
* Products → aggregate into → CartItems

---

## 🤖 Role of AI

LLM is used as a **transformation layer**, not the core system.

### Responsibilities

* Adapt recipes under constraints
* Normalize ingredient descriptions
* Suggest substitutions

### Not responsible for

* pricing logic
* product matching decisions
* aggregation
* optimization

👉 Core system remains **deterministic and auditable**

## 🧠 Design Principles

* **Stateful over stateless systems**
* **User memory over constant generation**
* **Deterministic core over AI chaos**
* **Structured data over raw text**
* **Separation of concerns (AI vs system logic)**
* **Production-oriented design from day one**

---

## 🔥 Vision

Cart Generator aims to become:

> A system that transforms stable human habits and constraints into optimized economic decisions.

Not:

* a chatbot
* a recipe generator
* or a grocery list tool

But:

* a **decision engine grounded in real consumption patterns**

---

## 📌 Status

🟢 Monorepo initialized
🟢 Frontend + backend connected
🟡 Core pipeline in development
🔴 Recipe system + cart generation pending

---

## 🧭 Next Steps

* Implement database schema (Prisma)
* Build BaseRecipe CRUD
* Implement ingredient extraction + consolidation
* Add product matching layer
* Introduce LLM adaptation pipeline
