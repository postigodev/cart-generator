# Architecture - Cart Generator

## Overview

Cart Generator is a layered system that transforms:

```text
visible recipes + user selections + constraints -> meal plan cart -> shopping cart
```

The core design principles remain the same:

- keep the center of the system stateful and deterministic
- use AI only for constrained transformations, not for core arithmetic, matching, or pricing

This document distinguishes:

- what is implemented today
- what is implemented but still transitional

## Current Implemented Flow

Today the backend can already do this:

```text
Visible recipes
  -> Cart draft persistence
  -> User selection
  -> Cart persistence
  -> Dish expansion
  -> Ingredient aggregation
  -> Product matching (mock catalog)
  -> Cost estimation
  -> Persisted shopping cart
```

That flow is implemented in the NestJS API under:

```text
apps/api/src/
|-- auth/
|-- cuisines/
|-- tags/
|-- recipe/
|-- cart/
|-- aggregation/
|-- matching/
|-- user/
|-- prisma/
`-- common/http/
```

## Current Conceptual Flow

The implemented model is:

```text
Recipe
  -> CartDraft
  -> Cart
  -> ShoppingCart
```

Interpretation:

- `CartDraft` captures editable user intent
- `Cart` is the stable recipe-based meal-plan snapshot
- `ShoppingCart` is the derived retailer-facing purchase basket

This split is important because:

- recipes and meal planning belong to the culinary domain
- shopping-cart generation belongs to the retail resolution domain
- one `Cart` should be able to produce one or more `ShoppingCart` snapshots over time

## Current System Layers

### 1. Recipe Layer

Purpose:

- store stable recipes
- separate global catalog recipes from user-owned recipes
- support editable user forks of system recipes

Implemented entities:

- `BaseRecipe`
- `DishIngredient`
- `RecipeStep`

Implemented rules:

- system recipes are global and immutable
- user-created recipes are private by default
- saving a system recipe creates a user-owned editable fork
- duplicate forks of the same source recipe are prevented per user
- recipe reads can now carry optional `nutrition_data` as derived metadata without replacing structured ingredients
- recipe reads now also carry expanded tag metadata, so dietary badges can be represented as explicit `Tag.kind = dietary_badge`

### 2. Selection Layer

Purpose:

- capture user intent for a specific meal-planning session

Implemented entities:

- `CartDraft`
- `SelectedRecipe`

Current status:

- draft persistence exists
- selection is currently draft-driven and cart-driven
- the main composer now lives in a large overlay that can create a draft, create a cart, or edit an existing draft/cart
- drafts are now treated as incomplete saved work, not the primary planning object

### 3. Cart Layer

Purpose:

- represent the meal-plan snapshot derived from recipe selections

Approved responsibilities:

- hold recipe selections
- hold retailer context for the planning run
- hold resolved dishes and servings context
- expose a derived aggregated ingredient overview from those dishes
- remain independent from retailer matching details

Current status:

- this concept is now explicit in API, persistence, and shared types
- `Cart` now persists `retailer` so the planning context survives draft -> cart -> shopping-cart generation
- cart reads now derive `overview` from persisted dishes instead of storing a second ingredient snapshot on the cart row
- `Cart` is no longer collapsed into the generated shopping output
- the web app now treats `Cart` as the primary planning artifact once a run is generated
- generating a cart from an existing draft should delete the draft so planning state does not duplicate itself

### 4. Aggregation Layer

Purpose:

- merge dish ingredients into one consolidated overview

Implemented rules:

- deterministic only
- no AI involvement
- ingredients are grouped by canonical ingredient + unit
- dish provenance is preserved in the aggregated output

Implemented entity:

- `AggregatedIngredient`

### 5. Product Matching Layer

Purpose:

- map aggregated ingredient needs to purchasable products

Implemented behavior:

1. generate a search query from canonical ingredient data
2. score candidates from a mock catalog
3. account for unit compatibility and basic conversion
4. pick a product and quantity
5. compute line totals and subtotal

Implemented entities:

- `ProductCandidate`
- `MatchedIngredientProduct`

Current limitation:

- matching is still mock-catalog based, not a real retailer integration
- manual shopping-cart edits exist, but quantity editing and richer provider behavior are not implemented yet

### 6. Shopping Cart Layer

Purpose:

- persist the retailer-facing purchase basket derived from a `Cart`

Implemented responsibilities:

- link to a parent `Cart`
- preserve the aggregated overview snapshot
- preserve matched products and selected quantities
- preserve retailer and estimated subtotal

Current status:

- this is now represented explicitly as `ShoppingCart`
- retailer matching still uses a mock provider boundary

## Current Access Model

The current API now has real auth without a secondary dev actor path.

Current behavior:

- unauthenticated recipe reads expose only global system recipes
- authenticated users can read global recipes plus their own recipes
- mutable recipe endpoints require authentication
- drafts and generated shopping results are always user-scoped
- `/api/v1/me` is the authenticated profile boundary
- `/api/v1/auth/*` provides register, login, Google login, refresh, and logout

## Current Web Surfaces

The current web app is intentionally split into separate surfaces:

- `/` is the planning home
- `/recipes` is the recipe browsing/library surface
- recipe detail lives in an overlay on top of `/recipes`
- the cart builder lives in a large overlay and can be entered from home or from recipe detail
- draft detail and cart detail stay in overlays so the user can work without losing workspace context
- shopping-cart detail now also opens as a large overlay from cart detail, so the retail output stays in the same workspace flow
- the shopping-cart overlay can now edit the same persisted resource by replacing matched products, adding manual items, and deleting lines

This keeps recipe exploration from competing with planning state on the same page.

Current interaction model:

- `Browse recipes` leads to `/recipes`
- `Add to cart` from recipe detail opens the cart builder preloaded with that recipe
- `Save draft` exists as a secondary persistence action inside the builder
- `Generate cart` is the primary planning action
- draft/cart detail overlays can reopen the same builder in edit mode
- draft/cart detail overlays can delete the current resource
- cart detail can now call `POST /api/v1/carts/:cartId/shopping-carts` and open the returned `ShoppingCart` immediately in an overlay
- shopping-cart detail can now search retailer products and persist manual edits through `PATCH /api/v1/shopping-carts/:id`

Current transitional auth setup:

- JWT access tokens are the primary authenticated path
- refresh tokens are persisted and rotated
- `User` is the ownership root
- `AuthIdentity` stores provider-linked identities
- `RefreshToken` stores hashed refresh tokens

## Live API Shape

The internal API now lives under `/api/v1`.

Implemented route families:

- `/api/v1/recipes`
- `/api/v1/recipe-forks`
- `/api/v1/cart-drafts`
- `/api/v1/carts`
- `/api/v1/shopping-carts`

Implemented mapping:

- `POST /api/v1/recipe-forks` replaces the older save-style command route
- `POST /api/v1/carts` creates the meal-plan snapshot
- `POST /api/v1/carts/:cartId/shopping-carts` derives a purchase basket from a cart

This keeps retailer integration behind the shopping-cart boundary instead of coupling it directly to recipe selection endpoints.

## Current State Boundaries

Persistent state today:

- users
- base recipes
- dish ingredients
- recipe steps
- cart drafts
- carts
- shopping carts

Persisted but secondary planning state:

- `CartDraft`

Primary planning state in the current UX:

- `Cart`

Derived but persisted shopping state:

- resolved dishes
- aggregated ingredient overviews
- matched cart items
- estimated subtotal

Derived at cart-read time:

- aggregated ingredient overview for `Cart`

Ephemeral state:

- request-scoped actor context
- request-scoped request id
- intermediate matching candidates during computation

Not implemented yet:

- recipe variants
- raw LLM outputs
- async matching jobs
- real retailer provider integration

Not first-class in UI yet:

- shopping-cart history and repeat-shopping revisit flows
- recovery or history after delete

## Current Infrastructure

Implemented local services:

- PostgreSQL for persistence
- Docker for local orchestration
- Prisma for schema, migrations, and client generation

Implemented supporting infrastructure:

- Swagger/OpenAPI
- request logging with `x-request-id`
- Postman collection for manual API testing

Not implemented yet:

- Redis
- background jobs
- real external retailer integration
- OpenAI integration

## Next Layers

### 1. Client Migration And Auth Hardening

Purpose:

- harden the client integration now that the first bearer-token web slice is in place
- remove the remaining temporary development fallback from backend flows and documentation

Current implemented direction:

- authenticated user context through JWT bearer tokens
- `/me` profile surface
- persisted refresh-token rotation
- linked auth identities per user

Current status:

- email/password auth is implemented
- Google token login backend is implemented
- refresh/logout are implemented
- `/me` is implemented
- `PATCH /me` is implemented
- `/me/preferences` is implemented for cuisine and system-tag preferences
- `/me/onboarding/complete` is implemented
- the web app now uses bearer-token auth for its dashboard flow
- the temporary `x-user-id` fallback has now been removed from normal backend flows and Swagger guidance
- the web app now exposes an authenticated `/account` surface for profile and preference management

### 2. Hybrid Tags And Controlled Cuisine

Purpose:

- support shared taxonomy plus private user organization

Status:

- explicit `Tag` and `RecipeTag` persistence is implemented
- `/api/v1/tags` is implemented
- dietary badge treatment should reuse curated system tags rather than introducing dedicated booleans per recipe
- recipes now accept `tag_ids` on write and return expanded `tags` on read
- explicit `Cuisine` persistence is implemented
- `/api/v1/cuisines` is implemented
- recipes now require `cuisine_id` on write and return expanded `cuisine` on read

### 2.5. Onboarding State

Purpose:

- distinguish "preferences are empty" from "the user has not completed onboarding yet"

Status:

- onboarding completion is tracked separately on `User`
- `/api/v1/me/onboarding/complete` is implemented
- the web app now routes incomplete users into a required onboarding flow

### 3. Real Retailer Provider

Purpose:

- replace mock matching behind the `ShoppingCart` boundary without redesigning cart resources

Status:

- the resource boundary is already in place
- the current provider is still mock-based

### 4. Adaptation Layer

Purpose:

- transform a base recipe under explicit constraints without replacing the original

Examples:

- cheaper
- halal
- vegan
- calorie-adjusted

Planned entities:

- `RecipeVariant`
- `RecipeAdaptationRequest`

Status:

- shared types exist
- runtime implementation does not exist yet

## Design Rules

- deterministic logic for aggregation, matching, and pricing
- AI only for constrained transformations
- explicit module boundaries
- structured data over free text
- shared contracts across apps
- system recipes remain immutable
- user-owned data is isolated by default
- retailer matching and purchasable-product resolution belong to `ShoppingCart`, even though `Cart` now keeps retailer context
